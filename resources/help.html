Email is the best and really only way to get my attention.</p><p>Cato is a database created to help booksellers list and maintain data related to their stock. It is designed so that users can tailor it to their own needs: keep, crunch, change, organize and analyze book data, sales data and to create useful reports. Practically any query of the data can be fulfilled by anyone within the program without resorting to a difficult query language.</p><p>Like many booksellers, I used HomeBase 2.3, which is a fine program, but it is becoming threadbare and showing its age. I tried HomeBase 3.0 and found it to be horribly lacking and a step backwards. Having programmed most of my life, I decided to take a whack at creating my own program.</p><p>The criteria I have used in planning and creation are as follows:</p><ul><li>Ease-of-use with a standard look-and-feel so it runs the same on any platform.</li><li>Runnable on as many computers and OSes as possible.</li><li>The user must have complete and utter control over the data.</li><li>As close to HomeBase 2.3 as possible to help others make the transition.</li><li>Easily extensible by use of templates where possible.</li><li>Data compatibility with as many other programs as possible.</li><li>Program must be free to download and use.</li></ul><p>Cato is written in Java using a flat-file database, runnable on many different systems, but is not currently networkable.</p><p><a href="0">Return to Contents</a></p><h2>§ System Requirements:</h2> <p>The only requirement is that the device be able to run the Java SE JVM 1.8 or newer. A processor less than 10 years old is recommended, although older may be usable. Java 1.8 is required. Unfortunately, older versions are no longer tenable. The windows are designed to fit on an 800x600 pixel screen, although 1024x768 or greater is highly recommended.</p><p><b>Install:</b>Due to security changes in Java, Cato's data folders are now stored in the user's home folder, which can vary from OS to OS. Cato itself should run from anywhere the OS allows.</p><p><b>File Structure:</b> The program and all of its support files live in the main Cato folder. There are a few folders, all with specific purposes, as  follows:</p><ul><li><b>system:</b> This folder holds all the database files, backups, logs, and other necessary files.</li><li><b>exports:</b> All Export files are stored here, Exports being books for listing or deletion on various listing sites. Exports will have a venue (listing site) name and a date stamp, as well as a three-character extension as part of the file name so it is easy to identify them. Also, any lists to export will be stored here.</li><li><b>images:</b> Can hold all of your book scans and photos if desired.</li><li><b>templates:</b> Templates are files used to import and export book data in any format.</ul><p><b>How Can You Help:</b> Cato is in his fourth revision and has been undergoing very heavy testing. He is ready for prime time.  Please take it for a spin, kick the tires and let me know what you like and what you dislike about the program. Also, if it does funny things that it should not do, let me know as well. I want this to be the best program available for what it does and every bit of feedback helps.</p><p>If this documentation is anywhere wrong or unclear, please let me know as well. I wish to make the program easily accessible and usable to all, despite some possibly confusing and difficult features.</p><p><a href="0">Return to Contents</a></p><h2>§ Getting Started:</h2> <p>Download and unzip the program. Most OSes will automatically unzip it for you after double-clicking on it. If not, you will need an unzip program to do the deed. You should find a folder containing a “Cato.jar” file and several other files and folders. Place this main folder and its contents wherever you would like the program to live. It is now completely portable.</p><p>Open the main folder and double-click on the Cato file to start the program.</p><p>Click on File and select New… You should now get small window asking for a new database name. Enter it and click OK.</p><p>Cato will now go about creating your new database and open the Settings window for you when it is complete. Take the time to fill this information in now as it is necessary.</p><p>The first tab will be your business information. All of these fields are available to be used on Invoices.</p><p>Once complete, click on the User-Defined Fields tab:  There are four sections here. Cato allows for five prices for each item. Each pricing is a Venue and can be an online listing service, like AbeBooks or Amazon, or can be In-Store, Mail-Order, etc., however you set your price points. You can also enter a monthly cost associated with listing at that venue. This dollar amount may be left blank as it not currently used.</p><p>There are two user-named fields available. These are part of each book record and the field can be named whatever you care to name it. Any alphanumeric data may be stored in either field, up to 256 characters. There are no other current programmatic uses for these fields, although this is a  possibility in the future.</p><p>There are three tax fields available which can be named as needed. These will show in the invoice window where the applicable tax can be checked to automatically calculate it and add it to the total (cost - discount + shipping). For the percentage field, enter it as a percentage and not a decimal. Thus, 5% is entered as “5” and not “.05”.</p><p>The final grouping allows you to set the date format, the currency symbol and whether the weights and measures are in Imperial or Metric. These will be used for reporting, Invoicing and catalog files.</p><p>The final tab, Misc: There are three sections. Basic allows you to set which website is used to look at pricing, pull down ISBN-related bibliographic data (currently, GoogleBooks is the only publicly available database that is free) and to set where your book images are stored on your hard drive. Cato will let you know if there at least one matching image for each book ID number. Click the button to the right of the image location field to browse to where you keep your images. If you leave it blank, Cato will just look in his own images folder.</p><p>The second section allows you to list which payment options are available for invoicing. Here, you would enter Cash, Traveler's Check, MoneyOrder, Credit Card, Livestock, First-born, etc., whatever methods you accept for payment from customers.</p><p>The last section has a number of fiddly settings, and the useless checkbox now not only has a purpose it also has some new friends.  The first checkbox allows you to turn off and on the ToolTips, those annoying little boxes with information you are hovering the mouse cursor over.  Following is to choose how Cato displays Publisher information when you request it in the Book Edit window. If checked, a tooltip will popup if you move the mouse cursor over the publisher field, <i>even of you have have tooltips turned off</i>.  If unchecked, Cato will popup the information in a dialog window that must be expressly clicked to dismiss.  The next checkbox determines what happens when  you close a tab by clicking the X.  If checked, any edited information will  be saved automatically without confirmation.  If unchecked, any changed  information will be automatically discarded, without confirmation</span>.   It is better to get into the habit of using the Save and Cancel buttons.    Finally, there is Auto-increment checkbox. Checking allows you to set the  Auto-increment feature on or off, along with the starting ID number.  The  starting ID number is updated with each saved listing and you can also edit  it at any time to change where your numbering will next start.</p><p>Once you have entered all of your data, click on Save and the original window will return to the fore and several more options will now be available. One big feature you will see is that there is also a note pad where you can enter and save notes, to do lists, etc. It is text-only and files are stored within the database, allowing you to leave notes for yourself and other users to see.</p><p>Now, since your database is set up, you will need to import some books. Click on the Books icon to open the Book List window. This is where you will see all of your books currently held within the database.</p><p>Now, click Import... under the Tools icon and you will see a dialog asking to choose which format and how to perform the import. Replace will clear the database of any listings and just include what you are importing.  Merge will attempt to add your new listings in with the old.  In case of duplicate Book IDs, Cato will append &quot;-2&quot; to the end for the ID.  Then, select which venue you would like the prices to be imported into.  Prices can always easily be copied across to other venues later.  Finally, you will get a file chooser. Choose a database file to import. The best choice is a complete HomeBase 2.3 export file followed by a UIEE file. If you are moving listings around between databases, the Cato native format is best. Please note that HomeBase Backup files are not usable for this purpose, nor will they ever be. The format is too complicated and full of extraneous data to be used. Select the file and click Open.</p><p>Once the import process is complete, the BookList window will now be populated with your books, a preview of the selected book (the line in the table grid that is selected), and some totals beneath that.</p><p>This bottom section showing the totals is very important—it only displays information on the books listed above. Thus, if you filter out some of your stock using the filter fields below the toolbar, the totals will update to only include the books listed. This very powerful feature allows you to create very tailored reports. As well, this is a very important concept regarding Cato. On any window that lists items, they can be filtered to show only a portion of all the entries. Any operations, such as a print or export will only use those showing in the list. To perform an operation to affect all entries in the database, all filters must be removed.</p><p>From here, you are on your own to poke around and see what everything does. Please note that there are some very powerful features that are not immediately obvious and you will need to delve further into this documentation to use them:</p><ul><li>Filters and filtering commands;</li><li>Macros;</li><li>Many features in the Book Entry window, including Spellcheck, Macros, Data Verification (auto-replacement function), negative price to exclude from exporting to a Venue, etc.</li><li>Special Edit Field view with extra large type:</li></ul><h3>Edit Field View</h3><p>Fields in the Book Edit view have a special feature. If you select the field and press F5, the contents will open up into the Edit Field window with extra large type. This is good for when the content is far too large for the original field, as in the case of the title or the keyword fields, or if your eyes are tired and you still need to work. The Edit Field offers Spellcheck, as well. Clicking the Save button, or pressing F5 again will accept your changes and take you back. Clicking the Cancel button or pressing the Escape key will abandon your changes and leave the field as was. The two plus and minus buttons can be used to increase or decrease the font size to your taste. Your font size selection will be remembered. </p><p><a href="0">Return to Contents</a></p><h2>§ Anatomy of a Window:</h2> <p>Only the main window has a menu bar. All windows have a horizontal tool bar across the top with little square buttons.</p><p>Windows are generally either List windows or Edit windows, or a combination of the two. All List windows have filter fields just below the tool bar, followed by the list itself in a table. The table can be sorted by a column by clicking on the column header. Tool bar buttons include Add, Edit, Delete and Print buttons. Below the list may be some data regarding the what is currently shown in the list. Edit windows have Print, Cancel, and Save buttons. The combined List/Edit windows are only available from the Book Edit window.</p><p><b>In the List windows:</b> The Add button will open a blank Edit window to add a new entry. The Edit button will open the Edit window, but populated with the data for the currently-highlighted entry in the table. The Delete button will ask if you wish to delete the currently-highlighted entry in the table. The Print button will print the entries currently listed in the table after asking you which columns you wish to have printed.</p><p><b>In the Edit windows:</b> The Print button will print the Edit window as shown. The Cancel button will discard any changes you have made and close the window. The Save button will save your changes and close the window.</p><p>There are several other buttons available on different screens and they will be described under the proper heading.</p><p><a href="0">Return to Contents</a></p><h2>§ Filters and Operators:</h2> <p>All of the List windows have from 2 to 8 filter boxes where you can enter search criteria to limit the number of entries shown in the list. The following operators are available to enter at the beginning of the filter to help include or exclude entries:</p><p><b>*</b> = Search anywhere in the field. Thus, entering &quot;*pear&quot; in the filter will include any entry that contains &quot;Shakespeare&quot;,&quot;Anjou pear&quot;, etc., in the specified field. Just the * will show entries that contain values.</p><p><b>#</b> = Show all entries that do not contain values.</p><p><b>~</b> = Exclude any entry which contains what follows. Thus, &quot;~shake&quot;will exclude any entry such as &quot;Shakespeare&quot;, &quot;shakedown&quot;, &quot;Brooklyn Shake&quot;, etc., in the specified field.</p><p><b>&gt;</b> = Show all entries greater than this value. Thus, &quot;&gt;corn&quot; will exclude anything before it in the alphabet (letter-by-letter), in the specified field.</p><p><b>&lt;</b> = Show all entries less than this value. Thus, &quot;&lt;corn&quot; will exclude anything after it in the alphabet (letter-by-letter), in the specified field.</p><p><b>@</b> = Show only those entries within this range. This filter command is a bit tricky. The format is &quot;@x@y&quot;, which is inclusive of x but exclusive of y. For example, &quot;@a@c&quot; and will show all entries from a to c, including all a and b, but excluding any c.</p><p>Any other characters used will include only those entries that begin with the entered filter.  A &quot;?&quot; may be used to represent any character. Thus, entering &quot;sm?th&quot; will give you all Smiths, Smyths, Smoths, etc.</p><p>You can use several filters for the same field. For example, &quot;*smith&quot; in an Author filter will show you all the authors with &quot;Smith&quot; somewhere in their name. If you add &quot;~high&quot; to another filter, you will see all Smiths, but only those without &quot;high&quot; in their name. Sorry, Patricia!</p><p>Please note that case is completely ignored and that they work with numbers, such as prices, as well. It is best to play with these until you understand them.</p><p><a href="0">Return to Contents</a></p><h2>§ Book List Window:</h2><p>The Clear button clears out all of the Filter fields and displays all records.</p><h3>Book Edit Window:</h3><p>This window is a bit of a monster and can only be opened from the Book List window.</p><h3>Toolbar Buttons:</h3><p><b>Save:</b> Save any changes to this listing. The only required fields are theBook ID, Title, and the first venue price field (Venue 1). Once saved, this window will close.</p><p><b>Save/+:</b> Save the current listing and then clear all fields to prepare for another listing.</p><p><b>Print:</b> Sent a screenshot of the current listing to the printer.</p><p><b>Price:</b> Search for prices for the current book. The website used can be selected in the Settings window. Clicking this button will bring the default web browser to the fore and open the specified site.</p><p><b>Cancel:</b> Cancels any changes to the current record and closes the window. This will exit out of the validation process, as well.</p><p><b>Validate:</b> At the bottom are 5 navigation buttons that take you to the beginning or the end of your listings, that step forward or back one listing, or run the Validation process.  Validate performs a number of tasks. It runs spellcheck on any text fields, even if SpellCheck is turned off. The contents of any field that can be populated from a table is verified against the available entries in that table. All appropriate Data Validation entries are applied. These are basically auto-corrects that you can create. See the Data Validation help section for more information. Finally, a very simple process is used to verify if the listing is a First Edition and if the book has a dust jacket. The ISBN field is also verified that any number in there has a valid checkdigit. Any errors that the validation process finds but is unable to correct are colored, allowing you to make any desired corrections. Finally, it inserts the current Time and Date in the Validated Date field to show that the listing has been inspected for errors. You can repeatedly hit the Validate button to recheck your listing. To look at only those listings that you haven't validated, use the &quot;#&quot; filter in the &quot;Validation Date&quot; field on the Book List window.</p><p>The plain buttons with with no content open a List/Edit window for the associated field. The button is always to the right of the field. The edit window allows you to add an entry to that table. If you have typed a value into the associated field, it will be brought forward to add or edit that value.</p><p>There are two buttons marked with stars. The one after the Book ID field can be used to clone a listing, mark all fields as sticky, or clear all sticky fields. When a Publisher is selected from the drop down, additional data may be available by clicking the button to the right of the Place field. The Place field will be filled in and a small, yellow popup window should appear when you hover the mouse over the Publisher, showing date ranges, locations and information regarding identifying First Editions.</p><p>The &quot;Include in Update?&quot; check box indicates if the record has changed and should be included in the next export. You can check it or uncheck, if needed. It will be checked automatically for new listings only.</p><p>There are five price fields, or Venues (or, if unnamed, they default to being called Venue x). Enter a price of -1 in a field if you do not want the book to be exported to that venue at all. Thus, if the second field is for Amazon, you could enter -1 for a price to prevent it from being exported to Amazon if the book is not acceptable for listing there (such as Teacher's Editions, Galleys, etc.) Do be sure at least one of the venue fields has a positive dollar amount entered into it.</p><p>Please note that there is a Status field and a Quantity field. Both are used and can be automatically updated if you sell a book. Depending on what export format you use, either or both are consulted. If you like, you can also use the Quantity field, although only one copy will be listed. If you sell a copy, you can drop the quantity by 1 and the &quot;Include in Update?&quot; will be checked, making the book relist with the next export. If the quantity goes to zero, be sure to set the Status to &quot;Sold&quot;, as well. You should be careful that if you sell a book that both of these fields are properly updated.</p><p>All of the dropdown fields have canned values that will be suggested as you type in the field. If you are editing any field and change your mind, hitting the Escape key will restore the value that was there when you first entered the field.</p><p><b>SpellCheck:</b> A few languages are available from the menu bar. You can also turn off SpellCheck there as well.  The English version uses a smallish dictionary of ~89,000 words and ~95,000 names. There's little point in having "snert" in your spellcheck dictionary if you accidently type it and it doesn't get marked. If you do mean to type it, you can always add it to the dictionary manually. If you right click on any word, Cato will offer a list of suggestions in a popup window, from a few to a fifty suggestions, depending on how lexically similar the word is to other words.  Cato chooses his English suggestions based on both bad typing and bad spelling. You should be able to type any word phoneticaly and get the correct spelling. Scroll to the bottom of the list to choose to add the word to the dictionary.  Cato keeps a user dictionary, but please note that he reads it in with any language selection.</p><p><a href="0">Return to Contents</a></p><h2>§ List/Edit Windows:</h2> <p>Presents the available values for a field or drop down:</p><p><b>Binding Styles:</b> Specifies type of boards or wraps used, such as Cloth, Leather, etc.</p><p><b>Binding Types:</b> Specifies Hardcover, Softcover, Cassette, CD/DVD, etc. In Homebase, this field is hidden and cannot be normally edited, but is attached to a Binding Style.</p><p><b>Book Conditions:</b> Short condition descriptions of books, such as Poor and Very Good.</p><p><b>Book Sizes:</b> Book sizes, such as Quarto, Duodecimo, etc.</p><p><b>Catalogs:</b> Categories for your books.</p><p><b>DJ Conditions:</b> DJ conditions, such as As New, or Fair.</p><p><b>Editions:</b> Edition description, such as Second Edition or First Thus.</p><p><b>Languages:</b> The language that the book is in.</p><p><b>Printings:</b> Printing description, such as Third Printing or Reprint.</p><p><b>Signed:</b> Description of how the book is signed, such as Signed By Illustrator.</p><p>The window below the toolbar is fully editable.

The Export button here creates a file that may be uploaded to a site which tracks Wants. Currently, only Abe is supported.</p><h3>Wants Edit Window:</h3><p>Allows adding or editing of a Want. As shown by the dot in the label to the left, double-clicking on the Client field will open a Client edit window, allowing you to add or edit a Client record.</p><p><a href="0">Return to Contents</a></p><h2>§ Invoices</h2><p>Invoices are templated, allowing you to create customized invoices for your customers. Double clicking the Client field will open a window allowing you to edit or add a client. Use the +Book and -Book buttons to add or remove books from the invoice. The +Book button opens a new Sales Edit record. The -Book button will delete the selection and double-clicking on a sale in the little table will open it for editing.</p><p>Custom Invoices can be created with an HTML template (named Invoice.html), using the following tokens:</p><ul><li>[[name]]</li><li>[[address1]]</li><li>[[address2]]</li><li>[[address3]]</li><li>[[city]]</li><li>[[state]]</li><li>[[country]]</li><li>[[postalcode]]</li><li>[[phone]]</li><li>[[fax]]</li><li>[[email]]</li><li>[[taxid]]</li><li>[[invoicenumber]]</li><li>[[date]]</li><li>[[client]]</li><li>[[user]]</li><li>[[comments]]</li><li>[[shipto]]</li><li>[[paymentmethod]]</li><li>[[taxes1]]</li><li>[[taxes2]]</li><li>[[taxes3]]</li><li>[[discount]]</li><li>[[shipping]]</li><li>[[taxes]]</li><li>[[finaltotal]]</li><li>[[salestable]] * Use &lt;table&gt;[[salestable]]&lt;/table&gt; Table attributes may be specified in the &lt;table&gt; tags. The inner code will be automatically supplied.</li></ul><p>Each token is tied to an entry in the Settings window regarding your business, or to a field in the Invoice itself. Any or all of the tokens may be used and Cato will substitute the proper values at print time.</p><p>Remove all tags between &lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt;. They are not needed. Images may be used and it is recommended that they be kept in the system folder with Invoice.html</p><p><a href="0">Return to Contents</a></p><h2>§ FTP Window:</h2> <p>This window is different from others as it handles your FTP accounts and uploading your files to the various venues to update your inventory.</p><p>Use the add/edit/delete buttons to maintain your upload accounts. In the edit window, enter a Name for the account, which can be whatever you desire. The hostname is the URL address that you wish to upload to. If there is a specific folder that you upload to, include it into the path.&nbsp; Cato will open the host and then move to the proper folder. Username and password are what are required to login to that specific site. The Venue you select is which price you want to be exported for that site and the Upload Format is the desired format to export to. After completing the entry and saving it, it will populate the main table.&nbsp; Cato should automatically negotiate the proper FTP connection, regardless of whether encryption is required or not.</p><p>There are three items to attend to for each entry which must be set every time you wish to perform an upload. If you do not want a venue to be uploaded, just uncheck the Up? check box. The default for the Book File drop down is Updated Books. You can also select None if you just want to upload an ancillary file and select All Books to export and send your entire database. You may also select Since, the entered date being the last time you uploaded your listings. Following these are all of the previous export files you have created that are located in the exports folder. If you need to resend a file, or have created a special export file, you can choose it here. For additional file, the default is None, but you can select any file which is located in the exports folder.</p><p>Both of these drop downs are created on the fly. Just close the window and reopen it to include any files you may have recently added since the last time you opened the window.</p><p>The Send button will, for each account listed, export the requested file, open an FTP connection and upload the appropriate export file and additional file. It closes the FTP connection and then moves to the next account, skipping any where the Up? checkbox has been unchecked. Once the process is fully complete, you will see get a message noting which uploads were successful and which failed with an error message.&nbsp; If an export file was generated, the Include in Update checkboxes are automatically cleared.&nbsp; If an upload failed, you can retry by just sending the file that was generated.</p><p><a href="0">Return to Contents</a></p><h2>§ Data Validation List Window:</h2> <p>This list window is available from the Tables menu. Data Validation records are, in effect, simple one-to-one substitutions of field values and can be assigned to the following fields:</p><ul><li>Author</li><li>Binding Type</li><li>Binding Style</li><li>Book Condition</li><li>Book Type</li><li>Catalog</li><li>DJ Condition</li><li>Edition</li><li>Illustrator</li><li>Keywords</li><li>Language</li><li>Location</li><li>Place</li><li>Printing</li><li>Publisher</li><li>Signed</li><li>Size</li><li>Title</li></ul><p>If the field value matches the Incorrect value, then the Correct value is substituted. </p><p><a href="0">Return to Contents</a></p><h2>§ Macros List Window:</h2> <p>The original Macro system is back.

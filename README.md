# Cato
 
Cato has been released into the wild.  There are still a couple of things to be completed and tested, organized, pruned, etc.  

Cato comes in two moods: Light and Dark. Two separate jars, same Cato. The light mood is Nimbus and the Dasrk mood is a Metal theme, proving Metal is not dead.  The only difference is, do not print while Cato is in one of his Dark moods. He will use all your printer ink. He's like that when he's like that. Wait for one of his lighter moods.

Some requisites and nods:

ftp4j-1.7.2.jar is required to compile Cato. It is avalable from here:
